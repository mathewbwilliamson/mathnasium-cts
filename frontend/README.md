*   Check Prisma Server to make sure it's production-ready (backend)
*   Uncomment secret in prisma.yml (Backend)
*   Need to figure how to delete an Event
*   Need to figure out how to assign Events to Leads and vice versa
*   Create Enter Event page (Started, need to get it running with validation)
*   Think more about what you need a new Event to have as a required field. Type, DueDate, message, messageTitle, lead (once you figure that out)
*   Need to figure out dates to finish Today list in GraphQL
*   Edit an Event Functionality (Started but need to finish Create Event Page)
*   Style the Option and Select boxes on the CreateEvent.
*   Figure out what permissions we will have for users
*   Create validation for Signup form
*   Create validation for Signin form
*   Change styles of signout button to the link
*   Reset Component: Make sure that when someone resets their password and it's successful, to route them to the main page.
*   For email services, he likes Postmark and SendGrid. I was going to use SendGrid, but Postmark would be worth looking into.
*   Reset Password Page: When it resets, Add a confirmation then route to the main page. At the very least, clear both the input fields. Use Router.replace('/')
*   Setup all the various Lead to User, Event to Lead, Event to User, etc relationships on the backend
*   Finish Manage Permissions page logic
